Welcome to the Github repository for DigiCamp & Propaganda Lab! We are a group of researchers based in the National University of Singapore.

Our project involves studying digital political campaigns of parties, candidates and media and how they engage with the public and target voters in the diverse political communication environments of Asia Pacific (India, Indonesia, Malaysia) in the context of growing misinformation and propaganda.
